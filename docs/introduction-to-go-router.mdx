# Welcome to go_router Package!

As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there is no widely known or officially recognized "Gorouter" package in the Flutter framework or the Flutter ecosystem. Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

It's possible that a package called "Gorouter" has been created or become popular after my last update, or it might be a custom package or project specific to a certain organization or developer.

To get accurate and up-to-date information about a package named "Gorouter" in Flutter, I recommend checking the official Flutter package repository (https://pub.dev/) or the official Flutter documentation for any developments or updates beyond September 2021. You can also search for it on GitHub or other code-sharing platforms to find more information and documentation if it exists.
<h1> GoRouter</h1>
The purpose of the [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package is to use declarative routes to reduce complexity, regardless of the platform you're targeting (mobile, web, desktop), handle deep and dynamic linking from Android, iOS and the web, along with a number of other navigation-related scenarios, while still (hopefully) providing an easy-to-use developer experience.

<h1>Why we need to use Go Router</h1>

In the context of Flutter, "Go Router" doesn't refer to a widely recognized or official package or component. Instead, it's possible that you are referring to a custom or third-party router package for Flutter.

However, if you're considering the use of a custom router package in Flutter (or any router package, in general), here are some reasons why you might want to do so:

<b>1.Advanced Routing Needs:</b> Custom router packages can offer more advanced routing capabilities than Flutter's built-in Navigator class. They can allow you to define complex routing scenarios, handle deep linking, and implement custom transition animations between screens.

<b>2.Modularity:</b> A custom router can help you modularize your Flutter app's navigation logic. This can make your codebase cleaner and more maintainable, especially as your app grows in complexity.

<b>State Management Integration:</b> Custom routers can be integrated with various state management solutions like Provider, Redux, or Riverpod to provide a seamless navigation experience that works well with your chosen state management approach.

<b>URL Routing:</b> Some custom router packages for Flutter may support URL-based routing, which can be useful if you need to handle navigation based on specific URLs or routes.

<b>Custom Transitions:</b> You can implement unique and custom transition animations between screens or pages using a custom router, giving your app a distinct look and feel.

<b>Navigator 2.0 Features:</b> Flutter introduced Navigator 2.0, which allows for more fine-grained control over navigation. Custom router packages can leverage Navigator 2.0 and build on its features to provide enhanced routing capabilities.

<b>Navigation Handling:</b> You may have specific requirements for how navigation is handled in your app that are not easily achieved with the default Flutter navigation system. Custom routers can provide the flexibility needed to meet those requirements.

<b>Community Solutions:</b> There are several third-party router packages developed by the Flutter community that offer different features and capabilities. You can explore these packages to find one that aligns with your project's specific needs.

It's essential to carefully evaluate your app's requirements and the features offered by any custom router package you consider using. While custom routers can provide additional flexibility and control, they also come with the responsibility of managing routing logic, which may require a deeper understanding of Flutter's navigation system and potentially more development effort.
