# Welcome to go_router!

The purpose of the [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package is to use declarative routes to reduce complexity, regardless of the platform you're targeting (mobile, web, desktop), handle deep and dynamic linking from Android, iOS and the web, along with a number of other navigation-related scenarios, while still (hopefully) providing an easy-to-use developer experience.
