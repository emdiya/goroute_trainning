# Welcome to go_router Package!

As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there is no widely known or officially recognized "Gorouter" package in the Flutter framework or the Flutter ecosystem. Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

It's possible that a package called "Gorouter" has been created or become popular after my last update, or it might be a custom package or project specific to a certain organization or developer.

To get accurate and up-to-date information about a package named "Gorouter" in Flutter, I recommend checking the official Flutter package repository (https://pub.dev/) or the official Flutter documentation for any developments or updates beyond September 2021. You can also search for it on GitHub or other code-sharing platforms to find more information and documentation if it exists.
<h1> GoRouter</h1>
The purpose of the [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package is to use declarative routes to reduce complexity, regardless of the platform you're targeting (mobile, web, desktop), handle deep and dynamic linking from Android, iOS and the web, along with a number of other navigation-related scenarios, while still (hopefully) providing an easy-to-use developer experience.
